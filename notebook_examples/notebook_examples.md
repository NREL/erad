* [Demo flooding simulation](https://github.com/NREL/erad/blob/main/notebooks/flooding_erad_demo.ipynb): This example shows how to simulate flooding in ERAD and use calculate survival probability function to update survival probability for distribution system assets. Note this example does not use Neo4J.
